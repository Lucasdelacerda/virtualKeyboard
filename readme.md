# Virtual Keyboard Project

This virtual keyboard project is being developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be responsive and functional on various devices. Currently, the functions of the buttons, space, and backspace are implemented. In the future, I plan to add features such as accentuation, shift, and caps lock.
